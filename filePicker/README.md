# <a id='s3' /> â–¶ Introduction

## <a id='s3-1' />Features

This file picker is able to

* Select multiple files and:
	* Get their path
	* Download them as [Files](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File)
	* Generate WebDav download links
	* Help you to easily generate Nextcloud share links
* Select a target directory and:
	* Get its path
	* Generate a WebDav upload link
* Upload local files

## <a id='s3-2' />Authentication

ðŸ”’ Supported authentication methods are:

* Provide a login and:
	* a classic password
	* an app password
	* an OAuth bearer token (see [OAuth token](#restrictions-with-oauth-access-tokens))
* Let the file picker authenticate on its own with the web login flow

âš  A login is still required if you want to use an OAuth token.

## <a id='s3-3' />How to include it

There are two ways to include this file picker in your web application:

* A Vue.js component
* A wrapper script

The file picker can optionally show buttons to open it an perform actions. You can also directly call the component methods to trigger the file picker actions.

# <a id='s4' /> âœ¨ The wrapper

Get it from NPM:
```
npm install --save nextcloud-webdav-filepicker
```

And import it:
```
<script src="[...]/node_modules/nextcloud-webdav-filepicker/js/filePickerWrapper.js"></script>
```
or
``` javascript
import('[...]/node_modules/nextcloud-webdav-filepicker/js/filePickerWrapper.js').then(() => { main() })
```

[Complete single file example](https://github.com/julien-nc/nextcloud-webdav-filepicker/blob/master/examples/without-vue.html)

Once you've imported `filePickerWrapper.js` you can call the `window.createFilePicker()` function
to mount the file picker somewhere in your web page. This function returns the component to let you interact with it later.

Parameters of `createFilePicker(mountPoint, options)` function:

* mountPoint (String): the ID of the element in which the file picker is mounted
* options: initial option values

Accepted options:

| key | value | type | default |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| url | the Nextcloud base URL | string | mandatory |
| login | the user name | string | - |
| password | the user password, an app password or an OAuth access token | string | - |
| accessToken | an OAuth token (use this parameter if you absolutely want to use HTTP Authorization header to authenticate. Using the OAuth token as a password is recommended, see [OAuth token](#restrictions-with-oauth-access-tokens)) | string | - |
| useCookies | Include cookies in WebDav and OCS requests if true | boolean | false |
| themeColor | the main file picker color | hex color string | Nextcloud blue: `#0082c9` |
| darkMode | toggle the dark theme | boolean | `false` |
| displayPreviews | toggle the file preview display | boolean | `true` |
| multipleDownload | let the user select multiple files in the file picker | boolean | `true` |
| multipleUpload | let the user select multiple local files to upload | boolean | `true` |
| closeOnError | close the picker on network error for getFilesLink, uploadFiles and downloadFiles (like when password policy refuses a link password) | boolean | `false` |
| enableGetFilesPath | show the "Get files path" button | boolean | `false` |
| enableGetFilesLink | show the "Get files link" button | boolean | `false` |
| enableDownloadFiles | show the "Get files link" button | boolean | `false` |
| enableGetSaveFilePath | show the "Get files link" button | boolean | `false` |
| enableGetUploadFileLink | show the "Get files link" button | boolean | `false` |
| enableUploadFiles | show the "Upload files" button | boolean | `false` |
| language | optional language for translation (xx-XX and xx locales accepted) | string | browser locale |
| useWebapppassword | use the webapppassword login flow as fallback when no other method is used or configured | boolean | `true` |

If login and password/accessToken are not defined, the file picker will let the user authenticate through the web login flow and get an app password by itself.

## <a id='s4-1' />Example

Here is a minimal example getting files paths and displaying them in the console:

``` html
<!-- The component will be mounted there -->
<div id="mount_point"></div>
<!-- Import the wrapper -->
<script src="filePickerWrapper.js"></script>
<script>
	// when the page is loaded
	document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', (event) => {
		// create and mount the component
		const filepicker = window.createFilePicker('mount_point', 'https://my.nextcloud.org')

		// listen to events coming from the component
		document.addEventListener('get-files-path', (e) => {
			console.debug('received "get-files-path" event')
			console.debug(e.detail.selection)
			e.detail.selection.forEach((path) => {
				console.debug(path)
			})
		})
	})
</script>
```

## <a id='s4-2' />Methods

You can open the file picker by calling opening methods:

* getFilesPath: open it to get files paths
* getFilesLink: open it to get WebDav links, optional parameter: an object with default link option values
	* `linkLabel` (String) to name the created links
	* `expirationDate` (Date)
	* `protectionPassword` (String)
	* `allowEdition` (bool)
* downloadFiles: open it to get files content
* uploadFiles: open the browser file dialog to select local files and then open the filepicker to choose a target directory to upload them
* getSaveFilePath: open it to get a target directory path
* getUploadFileLink: open it to select a target directory and get a WebDav upload link

Those are the methods of the filepicker component returned by the `window.createFilePicker()` function.
``` javascript
const filepicker = window.createFilePicker('mount_point', 'https://my.nextcloud.org')
filepicker.getFilesPath()
filepicker.getFilesLink({
	expirationDate: new Date('2050-01-01'),
	protectionPassword: 'example passwd',
	allowEdition: true,
	linkLabel: 'e-mail attachment to Jane',
})
```

## <a id='s4-3' />Events

Here are the events emitted by the component and the data they provide in the `detail` attribute:

* `filepicker-closed`: when the file picker is closed, whatever the reason (no associated data)
* `filepicker-manually-closed`: when the user closes the file picker with the top right close icon (no associated data)
* `filepicker-unauthorized`: when a WebDav request faced a 401 response code
	* `response`: the response object
* `get-files-path`: files were selected
	* `selection`: an array of file paths
* `files-downloaded`: files were downloaded
	* `successFiles` array of [Files](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File)
	* `errorFilePaths` array of path
* `get-files-link`: links were generated
    * `shareLinks` an array of Nextcloud share links, (only if link creation was successful, see [CORS issue](#create-nextcloud-share-links)), `null` if failed
    * `linkOptions` user selected option values for link creation (in case you want to make the OCS requests yourself)
    * `pathList` list of selected paths
    * `ocsUrl` OCS API URL to [create Nextcloud share links](#create-nextcloud-share-links)
    * `genericShareLink` an example of share link with "TOKEN" as the token value
* `get-save-file-path`: a target directory was selected
	* `path` the path of the selected target directory
* `upload-path-link-generated`: WebDav upload link was generated
	* `link` a WebDav upload link
	* `targetDir` the target directory path
* `files-uploaded`:
	* `successFiles` array of successfully uploaded [Files](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File)
	* `errorFiles` array of [Files](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File)
	* `targetDir` the target directory path

You can listen to filepicker events just like other events:
``` javascript
document.addEventListener('filepicker-manually-closed', (e) => {
	console.debug('The file picker was manually closed')
})
```

# <a id='s5' /> ðŸ‡» The Vue component

Get it from NPM:
```
npm install --save nextcloud-webdav-filepicker
```

And use it:
```
import NcWebdavFilePicker from 'nextcloud-webdav-filepicker'
```

[Complete Vue app example](https://github.com/julien-nc/nextcloud-webdav-filepicker/blob/master/src/views/ExampleApp.vue) (top component using the file picker)

## <a id='s5-3' />Methods

You can also open the file picker by calling opening methods:

* getFilesPath: open it to get files paths
* getFilesLink: open it to get WebDav links, optional parameter: an object with default link option values
	* `linkLabel` (String) to name the created links
	* `expirationDate` (Date)
	* `protectionPassword` (String)
	* `allowEdition` (bool)
* downloadFiles: open it to get files content
* uploadFiles: open the browser file dialog to select local files and then open the filepicker to choose a target directory to upload them
* getSaveFilePath: open it to get a target directory path
* getUploadFileLink: open it to select a target directory and get a WebDav upload link

To access these methods, put a `ref` to the `NcWebdavFilePicker` component and then:
``` javascript
this.$refs.myref.getFilesPath()
this.$refs.myref.getFilesLink({
	expirationDate: new Date('2050-01-01'),
	protectionPassword: 'example passwd',
	allowEdition: true,
	linkLabel: 'e-mail attachment to Jane',
})
```

## <a id='s5-4' />Slots

There is a slot for each button that triggers a file picker action:

* get-files-path
* get-files-link
* download-files
* get-save-file-path
* get-upload-fileLink
* open-file-input

The click event is catched by the file picker component, no need to listen to it. So you can put whatever you want in those slots, a click anywhere in the slot will open the file picker just like if the default button was clicked.

## <a id='s5-5' />Events

Those events are emitted by the component and the data included in the associated object:

* `closed`: when the file picker is closed, whatever the reason (no associated data)
* `manually-closed`: when the user closes the file picker with the top right close icon (no associated data)
* `filepicker-unauthorized`: when a WebDav request faced a 401 response code
	* `response`: the response object
* `get-files-path`: files were selected
	* `selection`: an array of file paths
* `files-downloaded`: files were downloaded
	* `successFiles` array of [Files](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File)
	* `errorFilePaths` array of path
* `get-files-link`: links were generated
	* `shareLinks` an array of Nextcloud share links (only if link creation was successful, see [CORS issue](#create-nextcloud-share-links)), `null` if failed
	* `linkOptions` user selected option values for link creation (in case you want to make the OCS requests yourself)
	* `pathList` list of selected paths
	* `ocsUrl` OCS API URL to [create Nextcloud share links](#create-nextcloud-share-links)
	* `genericShareLink` an example of share link with "TOKEN" as the token value
* `get-save-file-path`: a target directory was selected
	* `path` the path of the selected target directory
* `upload-path-link-generated`: WebDav upload link was generated
	* `link` a WebDav upload link
	* `targetDir` the target directory path
* `files-uploaded`:
	* `successFiles` array of successfully uploaded [Files](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File)
	* `errorFiles` array of [Files](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File)
	* `targetDir` the target directory path

# <a id='s6' /> ðŸ”§ More information

## <a id='s6-1' />WebAppPassword app and CORS headers

Nextcloud includes restrictive CORS headers preventing browsers to perform API requests.
The WebAppPassword app lets Nextcloud admins set a whitelist of allowed origins for WebDav requests.
As the file picker will be included in your web application outside of Nextcloud,
your website's domain needs to be whilelisted in order to make WebDav requests.

## <a id='s6-2' />Restrictions with OAuth access tokens

[WebDav client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webdav) is not able to generate WebDav download/upload links
if the authentication is done via Bearer Authorization (if you pass the OAuth token as the `ncAccessToken` prop).
You can still use an OAuth token to authenticate, just use it like a normal password and pass it as the `ncPassword` prop.
As Nextcloud basic auth supports OAuth tokens, everything will work fine.

## <a id='s6-3' />Create Nextcloud share links

As long as the CORS headers can't be changed on Nextcloud side to allow extra origins
(like it's done for WebDav endpoints in WebAppPassword), in most cases,
the browser can't make the OCS requests to create new share links on Nextcloud.
The file picker will still try to make those requests.
They will succeed only if the file picker is used under the same domain as the target Nextcloud.
If it fails, you can still do it anywhere else, on the server side of your web application for example.
The `get-files-link` event provides a share link template and the OCS URL to create such share links.
The OCS API endpoint looks like `https://my.nextcloud.org/ocs/v2.php/apps/files_sharing/api/v1/shares`.

Here is an example of link creation that you can do on your server side:

```
curl -H "OCS-APIRequest: true" -u login:token -X POST -d "path=/path/to/file&shareType=3" "$OCS_URL"
```

This will create and return a share link (shareType=3) with default permissions.
The share token can be found in `ocs.data.token` of the JSON response.
Then just place the token in the share link template.
For example, if `get-files-link` gave you `https://my.nextcloud.org/index.php/s/TOKEN` as share link template
and the token of the link you created is `wHx2BteGayciKiA`, then the share link is `https://my.nextcloud.org/index.php/s/wHx2BteGayciKiA`.

Just append `/download` to the share link to trigger the file download instead of displaying the share page.

## <a id='s6-4' />Save downloaded files

You can allow users to save the files downloaded by the file picker.
As the returned objects are Files (subclass of Blobs),
you can use [file-saver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/file-saver) to open a save file dialog
and let the browser write the files to local filesystem.

## <a id='s6-5' />Demo pages GET parameters

You can pass GET parameters to demo pages in order to initialize field values. It makes it easier to provide demo links directly working. For example:

https://julien-nc.github.io/nextcloud-webdav-filepicker/examples/with-vue.html?url=https://my.nextcloud.org&login=jason&password=Nm8cC-kHczM-HGz55-S9SE2-Frf4F&color=aa82c9&darkMode=1 (url, login and password are examples)

Accepted parameters are:
* url
* login
* password
* accessToken
* color (hex color without hash prefix, example: 'aa82c9')
* darkMode ('1' is true, anything else is false)
